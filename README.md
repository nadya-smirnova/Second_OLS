Microscopic sd-shell TBMEs obtained from the NCSM via OLS

This repository contains files with TBMEs for the shell-model calculations in the format of the shell-model code ANTOINE.
Those TBMEs have been obtained via OLS transformation applied to the No-Core Shell-Model wave functions for 18F calculated
within the Nmax=4 model space with hw=14 MeV. Three different NN potentials have been used: N3LO, JISP16 and Daejeon16.
The single-particle energies are taken from USDB Hamiltonian.
The corresponding two-body effective Hamiltonians in the sd shell model space are named N3LO, JISP16 and DJ16, respectively.
DJ16A is the monopole-modified version of DJ16.
