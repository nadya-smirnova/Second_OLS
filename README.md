# Second_OLS
Microscopic sd-shell TBMEs obtained from the NCSM via OLS

This repository contains files with TBMEs for the shell-model calculations in the format of the shell-model code ANTOINE.
Those TBMEs have been obtained via OLS transformation applied to the No-Core Shell-Model wave functions for 18F calculated
within the Nmax=4 model space and using different NN potentials (N3LO, JISP16 and Daejeon16).
The single-particle energies are taken from USDB Hamiltonian.
DJ16A is the monopole-modified version of DJ16.
